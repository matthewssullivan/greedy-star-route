# greedy-star-route
Greedy algorithm project for CSCI 3412 (Algorithms)
<br>
Description: We are trying to demonstrate how a greedy algorithm to find a route between stars in a
radius surrounding earth is an effective way of determining a “good” (not necessarily perfect) route
between the stars. To do this, we are going to take an online database of stars (the HYG or
Hippocarcos, Yale, Gliese database), which is in CSV format. We will read in this data and design a
traversal algorithm using the greedy principle of using locally available data to find the optimal
solution in that case.
